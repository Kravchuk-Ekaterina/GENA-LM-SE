Data for GENA-LM fine-tuning used from [DeepSE](https://github.com/QiaoyingJi/DeepSE). We used bed2fasta https://meme-suite.org/meme/tools/bed2fasta to extract sequences using the coordinates. Here we choose UCSC mammalian genomes, Human and hg19 (for mm1.s, h2171, u87).You can download the files here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h9s4HRJqFxzK0YICBIQPJ-h7i24H4-jb?usp=sharing
