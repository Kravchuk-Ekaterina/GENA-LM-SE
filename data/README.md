Data for GENA-LM fine-tuning was downloaded from [dbSuper](https://asntech.org/dbsuper/), [SEdb](https://bio.liclab.net/sedb/), [EnhancerAtlas 2.0](http://www.enhanceratlas.org/) and [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/). The data was preprocessed as described below:

The example of code for data preprocessing for one of the studied cell lines is in dataset_formation.ipynb. All preprocessed datasets used for fine-tuning can be found in this directory.
