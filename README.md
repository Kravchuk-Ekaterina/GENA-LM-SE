# SE_annotation
Super enhancers (SE) are long regulatory sequences in the genome that play an important role in enhancing the expression of certain genes. They largely determine the morphology and function of cells. It has been shown that changes in their structure and activity in many cases lead to cancerous transformation and the development of other diseases (Whyte et al., 2013; Parker et al., 2013). Most of the existing algorithms for their search require not only the DNA sequence, but also the data of expensive additional experiments. The aim of this work is to develop a SE search tool using only DNA sequence information. <br>
To solve the problem of searching for super enhancers, classical methods, machine learning approaches, including neural networks, were used. Most algorithms use data from Chip-Seq experiments, which provide information about SE key marks and are extremely useful for searches, but some researchers are taking steps to move away from using Chip-Seq data. Existing algorithms are aimed at classifying enhancers into conventional (TE) and super enhancers (SE).<br>
At the moment, the most used tool and the gold standard for solving this problem is the linear ROSE algorithm (Whyte et al., 2013; Lovén et al., 2013). An ML analysis of the importance of SE features was performed and the imPROSE (Integrated Super Enhancer Prediction Methods) tool was developed based on ML algorithms to predict which enhancers are SE (Khan, A., Zhang, X, 2019). ChIP-seq data, RNA-seq data, gene ontology, and DNA motifs were analyzed. They implemented six classic machine learning models including Random Forest, linear SVM, k-NN, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree, performed 10-fold cross-validation and compared them. The best results were shown by Random Forest (AUC=0.98). When only characterizing DNA sequences, such as phastCons, GC content, and repeat fractions, the authors estimated AUC = 0.81. This shows that only the characteristics of the DNA group protocol distinguish between TE and SE. With a possible neural network approach came the idea of using them to predict SE. There are works offering Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) solving this furniture. DEEPSEN, CNN implemented in 2019 was the first NN model implemented for this purpose (Bu et al., 2019). The next step was the implementation of DeepSE in 2021 (Ji et al., 2021). It outperformed the methods available at the time, using only sequence feature embeddings. A new moment was the use of k-mer sequence embeddings obtained by training dna2vec on genomes. Then the CNN classifier with 2 convolutional and 2 fully connected layers performs a binary classification (TE or SE). This tool has not gained popularity. At relatively high accuracy values, the precision metric did not exceed 0.48, while f1 did not exceed 0.52. In my work, it is planned to obtain results comparable to the results of models based on Chip-Seq data.<br>
For similar tasks, CNN, RNN, hybrid models (Gunasekaran et al., 2021), transformers were used. For enhancer annotation (TE), a task similar to that of this study, a hybrid model based on CNN and RNN was used: a convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by a recurrent neural network (RNN). They have been used to predict enhancer regions with histone modification marks as input (Lim et al., 2019). For the same TE prediction task, a BERT-based CNN architecture was created using only the DNA sequence as input (Le et al., 2021).<br>
For the annotation of various non-protein-coding genetic elements, which, however, have an important regulatory role, the DNABERT architecture was created, a pre-trained model is available. It can potentially be used for a variety of DNA sequence analysis tasks, including annotation of enhancers and super enhancers (Ji et al., 2021). In this project we plan to try using BERT and maybe apply transfer learning.
